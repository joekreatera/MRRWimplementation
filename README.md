# Manifold regularization algorithm extension using weights on supervised and unsupervised information

This is an implementation of the paper:

Li, D., Dick, S.: Semi-supervised multi-label classification using an extended graph-based manifold regularization. Complex & Intelligent Systems 8 (01 2022). https://doi.org/10.1007/s40747-021-00611-7

# Usage

All the libs can be installed with requirements.txt. It is fully implemented on python.
The test code can be run with:
```
python mrrw.py
```

This github repo contains a basic sample dataset: Emotions. That was obtained from [Mulan datasets](https://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html).
